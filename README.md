> Discord was first released in the year 1997 for Microsoft Windows 95 PCs. It shipped on eleven 3Â¼" floppies, making it larger in compressed size than Microsoft Word. It was the first real-time chat application to support full interlaced video streaming at 320x240 and 15fps, and 16-bit graphics.

# Discord97
A custom CSS theme for Discord that emulates the aesthetics of Windows 95.

## Requirements
- [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) or any other Discord CSS injector

## Current Status: Gimmick
This is really mostly a gimmick and proof of concept I built over an evening where i was fooling around with a retro-themed linux environment. There's a lot that looks bad, doesn't line up, and glitches abound. But it's cute, and that's what matters. ðŸ™‚
